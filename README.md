## Introduction
# Landing Page made with React and TailwindCSS
I coded up this landing page to practice using React with TailwindCSS. 


## Getting Started
# Install React & create react app 

```bash 
npm create-react-app project_name
cd my-project
```

# Install TailwindCSS
I recommend simply copy pasting the installation instructions from https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/create-react-app

```bash
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

You will need to configure some files, just follow the instructions in the TailwindCSS documentation.

## Technologies and Features

* React Icons
* TailwindCSS

## Reflections

I built this fairly quickly (over a few hours) and followed a tutorial I found on Youtube to track my progress and help organize the steps. I wanted to get more hands-on experience with TailwindCSS, and see how it compares to using Bootstrap 5. I will say, I am enjoying TailwindCSS more than Bootstrap 5, as it feels more customizable. 

I didn't run into many challenges with this, aside from the learning curve with TailwindCSS properties(converting sizes, figuring out the grid feature, etc). It was incredibly easy to design mobile first and add breakpoints. I like that you can still use glocal css styles if you like, but its really not necessary.
